The table below shows the length of the shortest solution for the individual levels as well as
the run time (in seconds) and the approximate storage requirements (RAM and hard disk) of the
sequential Sokoban solver using breadth first search.

You can specify the length of the shortest solution in the depth first search as the maximum
depth of the tree during the call, in order to shorten the search time. Note that the run time
of the depth first search is considerably higher than that of the breadth first search!
