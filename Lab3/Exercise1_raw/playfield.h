 * This class represents a given level of Sokoban, i.e., the playing field (board) with the
 * initial positions of the boxes and the player as well as the positions of the targets.
 * Internally, the playing field is not represented as a two-dimensional array, but in the form
 * of numbered fields:
 *  - 0 ... nBox-1       : Target fields (storage locations)
 *  - nBox ... nPos-1    : Other fields where boxes may be placed without creating a
 *                         dead-end (i.e., in principle it must still be possible to move
 *                         the box away from this field)
 *  - nPos ... nFields-1 : Fields that can only be occupied by the player.
 * The topologie ist stored in the array 'neighbors', which contains the left, upper, right,
 * and lower neighbor field for each field (if any, i.e., only if the field is not a wall).
